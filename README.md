# APB-Interfaced-SPI-Master-Core-IP-RTL-design-


# 1.INTRODUCTION 
This project focuses on the RTL design and verification of a 
SPI Master IP core with an Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) 
interface, commonly used in ARM-based SoC designs. The 
APB interface allows easy configuration and control of the SPI 
core through standard memory-mapped registers like Control 
Register 1 (CR1), Control Register 2 (CR2), Baud Rate Register 
(BR), and Data Registers. 

The core architecture includes modular components 
such as:

• APB Slave Interface for register-level control.<br>
• Baud Rate Generator for SPI clock configuration.<br>
• Shift Register for serial data transmission and reception.<br>
• Slave Select Logic for peripheral management.<br>

This project provided me hands-on exposure to register-transfer 
level (RTL) design, module integration.

# 2.PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous, full-duplex 
serial communication protocol developed by Motorola. It is 
widely used for high-speed data exchange between a master 
device and one or more slave devices in embedded systems. <br>


# Key Features of SPI Protocol: <br>
• Full-duplex communication: Simultaneous data 
transmission (MOSI) and reception (MISO). <br>
• Master-slave architecture: One master controls one or 
more slaves. <br>
• Clock-driven communication: Data transfer is 
synchronized using a clock signal (SCK) generated by the 
master. <br>
• Flexible data framing: Supports 8-bit, 16-bit, or more, 
depending on implementation. <br>
• Configurable SPI Modes: Based on CPOL (Clock Polarity) 
and CPHA (Clock Phase), SPI supports 4 modes.<br>

## 3. SUB BLOCK MICRO - ARCHITECTURE AND SIMULATION RESULTS 

# 3.1 APB SLAVE INTERFACE

The APB Slave Interface shown in the diagram below is a 
module designed to allow communication between a 
processor (or controller) and an SPI IP core using the AMBA 
APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol.<br>

# 3.2 BAUD – RATE GENERATOR

This module is responsible for generating the Serial Clock 
(SCLK) and associated timing flags required for SPI 
communication. It uses the SPI configuration inputs to 
calculate the appropriate baud rate divisor and generate 
edge-aligned control flags.<br>

# 3.3 SHIFT – REGISTER

This block is responsible for serial transmission (MOSIdata) 
and reception (MISObits) of 8-bit data over the SPI interface. 
It handles bit-wise shifting based on SPI configuration and 
clock edge detection flags. <br>
